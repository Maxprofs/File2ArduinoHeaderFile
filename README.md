# File2ArduinoHeaderFile
This .NET Core application converts files to byte array variables into a C header file for the Arduino Framework. In future you can also use the gzip algorithm to make the byte array more compact.

The main purpose of this is to make files available on ESP Web Servers. Icons, CSS files or HTML files for example. 

## Why .NET Core console application?
I like .NET Core and doing it this way, this tool is available in Windows and Linux.
